# Jalondi

Jalondi is a simple CLI based tool to create, view and extract JCR6 files. For me it will be used on a regular basis in my own projects, and hey, perhaps you have a use for it. 
It's licensed under the terms of the General Public License 3, and anyone with the tiniest form of experience should be able to use it. 

It will replace [NJCR](https://github.com/jcr6/NJCR) which will be deprecated from now on.
